# Running a MERN Application (Simplified)

This guide provides a simplified version of running a MERN application.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm (or yarn)
* MongoDB

## Steps

1.  **Navigate to the Client Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2.  **Start the Client:**

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

    (This will typically open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`).

3.  **Open a New Terminal Window:**

4.  **Navigate to the Server Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

5.  **Start the Server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    (Ensure MongoDB is running before starting the server).

**Important Notes:**

* This assumes you have already installed all necessary dependencies in both the `client` and `server` directories using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
* This also assumes your project is properly configured with a proxy if needed.
* Make sure MongoDB is running before you start the server.
* If you encounter errors, check the console output in both terminal windows for more information.
